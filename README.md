# nginx-https-proxy

This software is an nginx HTTPS reverse proxy with support for Let's Encrypt. It may be deployed using Docker. It is a container that has nginx and the Let's Encrypt certbot installed. It may be used to automatically obtain an HTTPS certificate from Let's Encrypt, then act as a reverse proxy for upgrading an HTTP service to HTTPS.

## Installation

To start using this software, clone this repository and then run `docker-compose up`. Then, follow the instructions in the next two sections to get an HTTPS certificate set up and to configure the redirect for your domain. You must have Docker installed to run the container, and you must haveand docker-compose installed to use the helper script.

## Obtaining new certificates from Let's Encrypt
```
certbot --nginx --no-redirect -d example.com
```

The helper script `gen-cert.sh` will run the above command inside the nginx Docker container for you.
```
bash gen-cert.sh [domain name]
```

## Configuration

You will want to obtain the certificate from Let's Encrypt using the command above before adding your site's configuration.

To set up the HTTPS reverse proxy for your site, copy the [example configuration file](nginx/sites-enabled/.example.com) from `nginx/sites-enabled` to a new file in the same directory. Edit the certificate location to match your domain name.

## Launching the service

Running the service is as easy as `docker-compose up` (or `docker-compose up --build` if you recently changed the `sites-enabled` directory. You may also run `bash start.sh` to start the service for you.

## Notes

If you want to generate your own SSL key for testing, you can do so with OpenSSL. You must rename the files accordingly.

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=example.com'
```
